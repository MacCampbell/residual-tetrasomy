For characterization of tetrasomic regions in salmonids

## Goals
To outline how to generate plots of similarities between tetrasomically pairing regions of salmonid genomes using any high-quality assembly.

## Files

10X.X - Sequentially ordered files of what to do

## File Structure

/data/ genomes by sub directory (in .gitignore as /data/*)
/outputs/ outputs (in .gitignore as /outputs/*)
